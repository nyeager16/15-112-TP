Darza's Dominion Python by Nathan Yeager (ntyeager)

Description:
This project is an open-world scrolling arcade shooter game where the goal is to level up
by defeating enemies in order to increase your stats and work towards beating bosses. The
game is very punishing, with health regeneration only possible through using potions which
are dropped by enemies. There are also no respawns, so a restart is required on death. The
map is randomly generated and split into different "zones," which are marked by the 
background color and determine the enemies that can be spawned there. The player always 
spawns at some point on the outside border of the map.

Running the project:
Open the folder marked "codebase" and run the file titled "Darza's Dominion Python" in 
an editor, making sure to keep the other files in the folder.

Shortcut commands:
Pressing "b" will spawn a boss to the right of the player for convenience due to its rare
spawn rate
